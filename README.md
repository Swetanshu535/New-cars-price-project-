New cars price project  shows the analysis of the dataset and forming the right dashboard



üöó New Cars Price Analysis Using Excel üìä

I recently completed an insightful data analysis project focusing on new car prices. The dataset included essential attributes like Car ID, Brand, Year, Engine Size, Fuel Type, Transmission, Mileage, Condition, Price, Model, Country, and City. By leveraging Excel's powerful functions, I derived valuable insights and created a dashboard for easy visualization.

The first phase of the analysis involved answering key business questions using Excel formulas and functions:

Model Count for Used Cars: I calculated how many car models in the store are used by applying COUNTIF to identify only those vehicles marked as ‚Äúused.‚Äù
Total Price for Manual Transmission Cars: To understand the market for manual transmission vehicles, I summed up the total price for all cars with manual transmission using the SUMIF function.
Average Price for EVs: For electric vehicle (EV) enthusiasts, I determined the average price using the AVERAGEIF function, filtered for cars powered by electricity.
Total Number of Cars: I used the COUNT function to quickly assess the total number of cars available in the dataset.
Mileage for Petrol Cars: To gauge the condition of petrol cars, I calculated the total mileage for all petrol-powered cars using SUMIF.
Model Name for Car ID 18: With a simple VLOOKUP, I retrieved the model name for the car associated with Car ID 18.
BMW Electric and Used Check: By combining IF and logical functions, I verified whether a BMW car was both electric and used.
The second phase of the project involved creating a dynamic dashboard for visualizing key metrics:

Automatic Transmission Cars (Slicers): I used slicers to filter and display cars with automatic transmission, enabling a more interactive user experience.
EVs and Brand Count: For EV lovers, I showcased a breakdown of electric vehicles by brand, providing a clear count of each.
Brand and Engine Size: The dashboard also highlighted the brand size and their total engine size, offering insight into performance metrics.
Total Price Across All Brands: A key metric on the dashboard was the total price for all cars, categorized by brand, calculated with a simple SUM function.
Countries and Cities for Brands: Lastly, I displayed the countries and cities where the various brands are available, providing a geographical overview of the market.
Overall, this project was a great opportunity to leverage Excel for data analysis, unlocking insights from the dataset while building a user-friendly dashboard for deeper exploration. Excited to apply these skills to even larger datasets and more complex projects! üöÄ
